# AI Web Scraper

## Overview
This project demonstrates an advanced AI-powered web scraper built with Python. It combines the power of web scraping technologies with artificial intelligence to extract specific information from websites based on user prompts.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Web Scraping**: Utilizes Selenium for handling JavaScript-rendered content
- **Intelligent Content Parsing**: Employs BeautifulSoup for efficient HTML parsing
- **AI-Powered Information Extraction**: Leverages LangChain and Ollama to interpret and extract relevant data based on user prompts
- **Proxy Integration**: Uses BrightData API for reliable and ethically-compliant web scraping

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup
- LangChain
- Ollama
- BrightData API

## How It Works
1. The user provides a URL to scrape
2. Selenium navigates to the webpage and retrieves the DOM content
3. BeautifulSoup parses the HTML for easy manipulation
4. The user inputs a prompt describing the information they want to extract
5. LangChain and Ollama process the prompt and analyze the webpage content
6. The AI returns the requested information based on the prompt and available data
